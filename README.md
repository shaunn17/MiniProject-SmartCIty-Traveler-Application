# Sem4-Mini-Project-Smart-City-Traveler-Application

 The system automatically searches for places of interest around the location. So, the traveller will not miss out on any attractions which he is unaware of. The interests and preferences of the user are also considered and the places are chosen accordingly.
 We make a list of sightseeing information according to sightseeing categories. In the result, we display both guidance routes on the map and guidance routes by text. The application displays a menu with main categories of attraction available in the city, by clicking on one of the categories all the related information is displayed.
